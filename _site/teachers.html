Based in Honolulu, he invites students to embrace movement within their bodies and to allow Afro Latin expressions to flow naturally. Afro-Latin and Orisha movements are used to enhance your own body awareness and produce more freedom within your dance expression. His method and style allow expression at any technical level to explore and grow comfortably. He believes that Salsa is a playground of movement and freedom and that everyone should be free to play.</p>
